        <p>Having spent about 50% percent of my life playing music and taking pictures, I'd say I'm pretty fond of Photography and just about any musical instrument.
            These days my interests have been taken over by my love of playing modular synthesizers.  The camera is used for documentation purposes of course.</p>

         <p>Always have been interested in the technical and I would have to say that modular synthesizers have led me to a path here as a student of coding.</p>
         <p>Electronic instruments are programmed through signal patching, sequencing and modulation.  You are the conductor, composer and programmer of your intsrument.</p>
         <p>Like a computer you have signal input and output that gives a direct result of the way you decide how to patch/program.  I'm a newbie to programming 
         and coding but it seems to have some parrallels to pretty much all other electronic devices.  Also, lots of parrallels to nature and how the world works.</p>
         <p>A little more meticulously spelled out in steps and commands. But very similar in the way things occur through the logical and yet sometimes
         unpredictable nature of all things.</p>
